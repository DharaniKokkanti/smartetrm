# ETRM System — Project Handoff Document
**Version:** 1.1 | **Date:** June 2026 | **Status:** Trade Capture + Credit & Risk Module Complete

---

## 1. Project Overview

Enterprise multi-commodity Energy Trading & Risk Management (ETRM) system built from scratch. Covers Oil & Petroleum, Power & Gas, Agricultural, and Metals & Mining.

**Core strategy:** Design for all commodities, implement Oil first. The architecture is commodity-agnostic at its core — commodity-specific logic lives in extension/plugin modules. This is non-negotiable and must be enforced at every architecture decision.

**Team:** Small dev team (2–5 developers) + 5–10 domain experts across all commodity types.

**Estimated timeline:** 14–20 months to full production with domain experts embedded from day one.

**API style:** REST only (JSON). Versioned via URL path (/v1/). RFC 7807 error format.

**Spring → Python communication:** Internal REST/HTTP calls. Python never initiates calls to Spring. Python is a pure calculation service — stateless, no direct DB access.

**Deployment target:** Not yet decided — architecture is deployment-agnostic (Azure/AWS/GCP/on-premise). Terraform from day one regardless.

### Script 9: Product Spec / MOT / Pipeline (combined with Script 5 above)

---

## 5. Key Design Decisions

### Polymorphic shared tables
`address`, `tax_registration`, `bank_account`, `contact` all use `entity_type + entity_id` pattern. Enforced via CHECK constraint + application layer. Covers legal_entity, counterparty, location, storage_facility.

### Temporal tables (SQL Server system versioning)
Applied to: `legal_entity`, `app_user`, `book`, `counterparty`, `trader`, `trader_commodity_limit`, `pricing_rule`, `trade_pricing_schedule`. Every change auto-historised by SQL Server — zero application code required. Regulatory requirement.

### Trader limits split
`trader` = person identity only. `trader_commodity_limit` = authorisation per commodity. One trader covering OIL and POWER gets two limit rows — independent daily limits, position limits, approvers per commodity. Time-bounded for temporary limit changes.

### Product specs
Three-level spec hierarchy: `product_spec_template` → `product_spec_value` (min/max/typical per parameter). `spec_override` for pipeline/vessel/tank tighter requirements. Option A chosen: separate min/max/typical columns (not range table).

### Pipeline product approval — three levels
1. Pipeline level: `pipeline_product_approval` (what products allowed on this pipeline)
2. Point level: `pipeline_point_product` (restrictions at specific entry/exit points)
3. Segment level: `pipeline_segment_product` (older segments may restrict certain products)

### MOT asset product approval
`mot_asset_product_approval` is polymorphic covering vessel, truck, railcar, container, tank — same concept as pipeline approval but for individual physical assets.

### Pricing lifecycle (Option B two-step validation)
Raw feed → `pricing_event_staging` (with spike detection + cross-source check) → validation gate → `pricing_event.actual_value`. Gives clean audit trail and prevents bad data hitting formula calculation.

### Period table (unified)
Single `period` table serves both trading periods and risk buckets via `is_trading_period` and `is_risk_period` flags. Rolling periods (M+1, Q+1, CAL+1) use offset rules resolved at runtime. Concrete periods pre-generated 2026–2031.

**SmartETRM full application** running on Vite + React 18, Ant Design 5, AG Grid, React Query, Zustand, MSW (Mock Service Worker).

**Organization & Reference:**
- Legal entity, counterparty (with KYC status), trader management
- Desks, books, brokers with fee agreement setup
- Currencies, UoM, UoM conversions, countries, incoterms

**Markets & Products:**
- Markets, exchanges, price indices, price sources
- Products — with quality spec tabs (blend recipe + spec template accordion), pricing basis fields

**Logistics & Calendar:**
- Locations, vessels, pipelines, trucks, storage facilities
- Holiday calendars, trading periods

**Pricing:**
- Pricing rules (assembled: product + market + trigger + window + FX handling)
- Price sources

**Contracts:**
- Payment terms (redesigned: base date event, month offset, business day convention, discount %)
- Payment methods, GTCs, broker fee agreements

**Credit & Risk (V35):**
- **Margin Agreements** — CSA/pledge setup per counterparty: threshold, MTA, independent amount, eligible collateral, valuation frequency, governing law
- **Credit Limits** — pre-settlement, settlement, delivery, MTM limits per counterparty with real-time utilisation % bar
- **Letters of Credit** — standby/documentary/revolving/transferable LCs: face value, drawdown tracking, evergreen/auto-renewal provisions, expiry alert index; summary stats band (total face value, total available, total drawdown, active count)
- **Credit Hub** — hub card page at `/credit` linking to all three sections

**Trade Capture:**
- **Trade Blotter** — redesigned Trade → Order/Leg → Item three-tier hierarchy:
  - Trade = contract header only (counterparty, trader, trade date, contract number, term type SPOT/RFP, deal indicator INTERNAL/EXTERNAL)
  - RFP fields (min/max qty, start/end dates, frequency) shown conditionally when term_type = RFP
  - Legs panel always visible below trade grid; first leg auto-tagged TEMPLATE, subsequent legs are detail legs; commodity-specific delivery fields (product, market, pricing rule, risk dates, qty, price, settlement, incoterm, delivery location) all on legs only
  - Items section shown when a leg is selected

**Admin:**
- System users, roles & permissions, field-level permissions (EDIT/VIEW/HIDDEN per field per role profile)

**Infrastructure:**
- AppRouter with lazy-loaded routes for all modules
- AppShell with collapsible sidebar, dark/light theme toggle, API activity log drawer
- MSW handlers for all endpoints (crudHandlers helper + custom handlers for suspend/reinstate/cancel)
- React Query cache with `['resource']` keys; useMutation with cache invalidation on success

| V45 | `V45__commodity_instrument_type_config.sql` | **Commodity → instrument type mapping**: creates `dbo.commodity_instrument_type_config` (PK: commodity_type + instrument_type; is_active, sort_order). Authoritative DB-side config — frontend fetches via `GET /commodity-instrument-map` (staleTime: Infinity); no UI CRUD, only DBA/vendor adds rows via migration. Captures market-specific rules: RINS/ENVIRONMENTAL have CERTIFICATE_TRANSFER not PHYSICAL; POWER has no TRANSPORT_AGREEMENT; FREIGHT = FFA market only (no storage, limited options). Seed: 9 commodities × their valid instrument types. |
| V46 | `V46__physical_price_adjustments_demurrage.sql` | **Physical leg enrichments — origin country, demurrage, price adjustments**: ALTERs `dbo.trade_order` to add `origin_country_code CHAR(2)` (ISO 3166-1 alpha-2, for sanctions screening), `demurrage_rate`, `demurrage_currency`, `demurrage_basis` (REVERSIBLE / NON_REVERSIBLE / AVERAGED), `allowed_laytime_hours`, `despatch_rate`; creates `dbo.trade_order_price_adjustment` (adjustment_id PK, order_id FK CASCADE, adjustment_type CHECK 15 values, adjustment_value, currency, uom_code, sort_order, notes); seeds `price_adjustment_type` (15 rows: API_GRAVITY, DENSITY, HEAT_CONTENT, SULFUR, PROTEIN, MOISTURE, TEST_WEIGHT, ASSAY, TREATMENT_CHARGE, REFINING_CHARGE, QUALITY_PREMIUM, QUALITY_DISCOUNT, TAX, MARKUP, FX_DIFFERENTIAL) and `demurrage_basis` (3 rows) into `dbo.lookup_value`; seeds origin country and demo price adjustments onto existing physical orders |
| V47 | `V47__storage_type_commodity_type_alignment.sql` | **Storage type canonicalization + commodity type extension**: remaps legacy `dbo.storage_facility.facility_type` codes to the canonical vocabulary (TANK→TANK_FARM, CAVERN→SALT_CAVERN, LNG_TERMINAL→LNG_TANK, GRAIN_SILO→SILO) and replaces the CHECK with the canonical 14 codes (TANK_FARM, FLOATING_STORAGE, WAREHOUSE, SALT_CAVERN, GAS_STORAGE, PIPELINE_LINEFILL, LNG_TANK, SILO, REFRIGERATED_STORAGE, CHEMICAL_TANK, FSRU, REFINERY, VAULT, OTHER — matches frontend STORAGE_TYPES exactly); updates `dbo.storage_facility_type` parent lookup in place and inserts the 6 new codes; extends the commodity_type CHECK on `dbo.book`, `dbo.desk`, `dbo.gl_account`, `dbo.trader_commodity_limit` from 7 to 11 values (adds LNG, FREIGHT, RINS, ENVIRONMENTAL) so desks/books/GL accounts can be classified for every tradeable commodity. **Also fixed in this pass (in-place, migrations not yet run):** V36/V37/V38/V44/V46 `lookup_value` INSERTs corrected from non-existent `(table_name, type_code, type_name, description)` columns to the actual `(category, code, display_name, notes)` schema defined in V1 |
| V48 | `V48__special_reference.sql` | **Special reference replaces special contract flag**: adds `special_reference NVARCHAR(180) NULL` to `dbo.trade` (free-text reference to side letters / bespoke clauses — a special contract carries a reference, not a boolean); migrates rows where `special_contract_flag = 1` to a LEGACY placeholder text, then drops the flag column and its default constraint. TS: `Trade.specialReference: string \| null` replaces `specialContractFlag: boolean`; form shows a 180-char counted Input in Contract Controls |
| V49 | `V49__credit_limit_expansion.sql` | **Credit limit module expansion**: ALTERs `dbo.credit_limit` with 22 new columns across four groups — *scope*: `commodity_type` (ALL + 11 commodities), `limit_basis` (DIRECT / ALLOCATED), `parent_limit_id` self-FK for group-umbrella hierarchies, `cp_country_code`, `country_risk_rating` (LOW→SEVERE); *amounts*: `collateral_offset` + `collateral_ref` (LC/PCG raises capacity), `temp_uplift_amount` + `temp_uplift_expiry`, `tenor_cap_months`; *governance*: `credit_analyst_user_id/name`, `review_frequency_days`, `last/next_review_date` (next auto-derived), `last_review_outcome` (MAINTAIN/INCREASE/DECREASE/SUSPEND/ESCALATE), `internal_rating`, `external_rating`; *monitoring*: `warning/critical_threshold_pct`, `breach_action` (ALERT_ONLY / BLOCK_NEW_TRADES / BLOCK_ALL), `alert_internal`, `alert_counterparty` + `cp_alert_email`. `limit_type` CHECK gains TOTAL_AGGREGATE; status gains UNDER_REVIEW. New tables: `dbo.credit_limit_line_item` (instrument-class sub-limits: PHYSICAL/FUTURES/FORWARDS/SWAPS/OPTIONS/STORAGE_TRANSPORT, unique per limit+class, CASCADE) and `dbo.credit_limit_alert` (event log: threshold/breach/review-due/expiry/status alerts with recipients INTERNAL/COUNTERPARTY/BOTH and acknowledgement tracking). Seeds 6 lookup categories. Frontend: rebuilt CreditLimitsPage — two-column drawer, analyst dropdown from app users, auto country fill from CP, parent-limit select for allocations, sub-limits Form.List, read-only alert timeline; MSW computes availability/utilisation/traffic-light server-side |

## 14. Static Data Admin UI — Lookup Table Design

Payment term dropdowns (Base Date Event and Business Day Convention) are driven by managed lookup tables, not hardcoded TypeScript enums. This means operations teams can add new event types without code changes.

**Pattern:**
1. Lookup table in SQL (e.g. `base_date_event_type`) with `type_code` matching the CHECK constraint on the data column
2. Entry in `PARENT_LOOKUP_TABLES` array in `referenceData.ts` — auto-registers the table in the Tier 2 Static Data UI
3. Frontend uses `useTableRows('base_date_event_type')` hook to load options at runtime
4. Form select uses grouped options (`applicableCommodity` as group header) with search enabled

**Tables managed via Static Data UI:**
- `base_date_event_type` — 11 payment date anchors (BL_DATE, DELIVERY_DATE, END_OF_DELIVERY_MONTH, etc.)
- `business_day_convention_type` — 5 BD rolling rules (MOD_FOLLOWING, FOLLOWING, etc.)
- `crude_grade_type` — 14 named crude grades (BRENT, WTI, FORTIES, URALS, DUBAI, ESPO, etc.) with region and benchmark index
- `metal_shape` — 9 physical metal forms (CATHODE, INGOT, BILLET, COIL, ROD, SLAB, WIRE, POWDER, T_BAR)
- `gas_day_type` — 3 gas day boundary types (STANDARD 06:00–06:00, MIDNIGHT, EXTENDED)
- `nomination_type` — 3 gas nomination types (FIRM, INTERRUPTIBLE, RENOMINATABLE)
- `lng_price_basis` — 6 LNG price linkages (JCC, HH, TTF, NBP, DES_SPOT, HYBRID)
- `power_load_type` — 4 power load profiles (BASELOAD, PEAK, OFF_PEAK, SHAPED)
- All other `PARENT_LOOKUP_TABLES` entries (commodity type, pricing type, UoM class, etc.)

**TradeBlotter dropdowns** — all formerly-hardcoded option arrays replaced with `useTableRows()` hooks and `useUom()`:
| Previously hardcoded | Now served by |
|---|---|
| `UOM_OPTIONS` | `useUom()` → `/api/v1/uom` |
| `CURRENCY_OPTIONS` | `useTableRows('currency')` |
| `CRUDE_GRADES` | `useTableRows('crude_grade_type')` |
| `METALS_SHAPES` | `useTableRows('metal_shape')` |
| `LNG_PRICE_BASES` | `useTableRows('lng_price_basis')` |
| inline `nominationType` options | `useTableRows('nomination_type')` |
| inline `gasDayType` options | `useTableRows('gas_day_type')` |
| inline `loadType` options | `useTableRows('power_load_type')` |

## 14a. Product Blend & Quality Spec Data Model

### Blend Products
A product can be flagged `is_blend = true` to indicate it is manufactured by blending component products. The recipe is stored in `product_blend_component`:

```
product_blend_component
├── parent_product_id    → blended product (e.g. GAS97-BLEND)
├── component_product_id → a constituent (e.g. ULSD-10PPM, ETHANOL)
├── sequence_no          → display order
├── min_pct / target_pct / max_pct  → volume-basis blending recipe
├── tolerance_pct        → allowable variance from target
└── needs_position_gen   → (V27) BIT; TRUE = position engine creates a sub-position for this
                           component in addition to the parent blend position;
                           FALSE = component tracked only within the blended product position
```

**Example**: GAS97-BLEND = Component 1: ULSD-10PPM (target 97%vol ±0.5%) + Component 2: ETHANOL (target 3%vol ±0.25%).

### Quality Spec Templates
Spec data flows through three linked tables:

```
spec_parameter (parameter catalogue — API gravity, sulphur %, GCV, purity %, etc.)
    └── product_spec_template (named spec per product — e.g. EN590_10PPM for ULSD)
            └── product_spec_value (min/max/typical bounds per parameter)
                    └── spec_override (pipeline or vessel tighter requirements) [future]
```

**Seeded standards** (V24):
| Template Code | Product | Standard |
|---|---|---|
| DTBRT_BFOE_STD | BRENT-CRUDE | BFOE MoU 2023 |
| WTI_NYMEX_STD | WTI-CRUDE | NYMEX Rule 200 |
| TTF_EFET_2020 | TTF-GAS | NTA 8000 / EFET 2020 |
| LME_CU_GRADE_A | LME-COPPER | LME Annex A / BS EN 1978 |
| EN590_10PPM | ULSD-10PPM | EN 590:2022+A1 |
| GAS97_INTERNAL | GAS97-BLEND | EN 228:2012 / Internal |

### Frontend — ProductsPage Quality Specs Tab
The `ProductsPage.tsx` drawer now has 4 tabs:
- **Details** — all product fields including `isBlend` switch and `blendNotes` (shown when blend enabled)
- **Price Indices** — link/unlink price index relationships
- **Markets** — read-only view of market listings
- **Quality Specs** — blend recipe (when `isBlend=true`) + spec template accordion with parameter bounds table

## 14b. UoM Conversion Architecture — Cross-Type Constraint

**Only same-type conversions belong in `uom_conversion`.**

| Same-type (stored in `uom_conversion`) | Cross-type (product-specific only) |
|---|---|
| VOLUME → VOLUME (BBL→GAL, BBL→CBM) | VOLUME → WEIGHT (BBL→MT requires density) |
| WEIGHT → WEIGHT (MT→KG, MT→LB) | VOLUME → ENERGY (SCM→MWH requires GCV) |
| ENERGY → ENERGY (MWH→MMBTU, MWH→GJ) | WEIGHT → ENERGY (not currently traded) |

Cross-type conversions (e.g. BBL↔MT, SCM↔MWH) are **not** stored as commodity-level defaults because the conversion factor differs for every product:

| Product | density (kg/m³) | 1 BBL → MT |
|---|---|---|
| Brent crude | ~833 | 0.13240 |
| WTI crude | ~825 | 0.13113 |
| ULSD | ~845 | 0.13432 |
| Fuel Oil 380 | ~990 | 0.15741 |

Instead, the position engine reads from the `product` table pricing basis fields:
- **OIL**: `density_estimate_kg_m3` / `density_base_kg_m3` → `MT = BBL × 0.158987 × density / 1000`
- **GAS**: `cv_gross_mj_scm` / `cv_net_mj_scm` → `MWH = SCM × cv_gross / 3600`; `MMBTU = SCM × cv_gross / 1055.056`

`density_estimate_kg_m3` is used for daily MTM; `density_base_kg_m3` is the reference/contract value for invoice settlement.

---

## 14c. Field-Level Permission Architecture (V26)

Two-layer model. Layer 1 always wins over Layer 2.

### Layer 1 — Object Lifecycle Locks (`object_lock_rule`)
Developer-owned, deployed via Flyway only. When an entity reaches a lifecycle state (CONFIRMED, MATURED, CLOSED, CANCELLED, INVOICED), specified fields are automatically locked to READ_ONLY or HIDDEN regardless of user role. Examples:
- Trade CONFIRMED → price, quantity, currency → READONLY
- Trade CLOSED → all fields → READONLY

### Layer 2 — Field Permission Profiles (`field_permission_profile` + `field_permission_rule`)
Client-admin-configurable via the **Field-Level Permissions** admin page. Profiles are scoped to one screen. Each profile assigns per-field access (EDIT / VIEW / HIDDEN) to a role. `is_required_field=1` fields cannot be set below VIEW by either layer.

**Merge rule**: `effective = min(Layer1, Layer2)` where HIDDEN < VIEW < EDIT.

### Frontend Hook
`useFieldPermissions(screenCode, roleIds)` → returns a map `fieldKey → AccessLevel`. Used by `PermissionField` wrapper component which renders fields as editable/read-only/hidden based on effective access level.
