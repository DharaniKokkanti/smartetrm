# ETRM System — Project Handoff Document
**Version:** 1.0 | **Date:** June 2026 | **Status:** Master Data Phase Complete

---

## 1. Project Overview

Enterprise multi-commodity Energy Trading & Risk Management (ETRM) system built from scratch. Covers Oil & Petroleum, Power & Gas, Agricultural, and Metals & Mining.

**Core strategy:** Design for all commodities, implement Oil first. The architecture is commodity-agnostic at its core — commodity-specific logic lives in extension/plugin modules. This is non-negotiable and must be enforced at every architecture decision.

**Team:** Small dev team (2–5 developers) + 5–10 domain experts across all commodity types.

**Estimated timeline:** 14–20 months to full production with domain experts embedded from day one.

**API style:** REST only (JSON). Versioned via URL path (/v1/). RFC 7807 error format.

**Spring → Python communication:** Internal REST/HTTP calls. Python never initiates calls to Spring. Python is a pure calculation service — stateless, no direct DB access.

**Deployment target:** Not yet decided — architecture is deployment-agnostic (Azure/AWS/GCP/on-premise). Terraform from day one regardless.

## 5. Key Design Decisions

### Polymorphic shared tables
`address`, `tax_registration`, `bank_account`, `contact` all use `entity_type + entity_id` pattern. Enforced via CHECK constraint + application layer. Covers legal_entity, counterparty, location, storage_facility.

### Temporal tables (SQL Server system versioning)
Applied to: `legal_entity`, `app_user`, `book`, `counterparty`, `trader`, `trader_commodity_limit`, `pricing_rule`, `trade_pricing_schedule`. Every change auto-historised by SQL Server — zero application code required. Regulatory requirement.

### Trader limits split
`trader` = person identity only. `trader_commodity_limit` = authorisation per commodity. One trader covering OIL and POWER gets two limit rows — independent daily limits, position limits, approvers per commodity. Time-bounded for temporary limit changes.

### Product specs
Three-level spec hierarchy: `product_spec_template` → `product_spec_value` (min/max/typical per parameter). `spec_override` for pipeline/vessel/tank tighter requirements. Option A chosen: separate min/max/typical columns (not range table).

### Pipeline product approval — three levels
1. Pipeline level: `pipeline_product_approval` (what products allowed on this pipeline)
2. Point level: `pipeline_point_product` (restrictions at specific entry/exit points)
3. Segment level: `pipeline_segment_product` (older segments may restrict certain products)

### MOT asset product approval
`mot_asset_product_approval` is polymorphic covering vessel, truck, railcar, container, tank — same concept as pipeline approval but for individual physical assets.

### Pricing lifecycle (Option B two-step validation)
Raw feed → `pricing_event_staging` (with spike detection + cross-source check) → validation gate → `pricing_event.actual_value`. Gives clean audit trail and prevents bad data hitting formula calculation.

### Period table (unified)
Single `period` table serves both trading periods and risk buckets via `is_trading_period` and `is_risk_period` flags. Rolling periods (M+1, Q+1, CAL+1) use offset rules resolved at runtime. Concrete periods pre-generated 2026–2031.

## 10. What's Been Built (Prototype)

**Master data GUI prototype** (React artifact) — tabbed interface covering:
- Legal entity management (add/edit/delete + Excel upload)
- Counterparty management with KYC status filter
- Trader management linked to legal entities
- Excel upload with duplicate rejection and row-level validation
- API call log panel showing all POST/PUT/DELETE calls
- Download template functionality

**Export files created:**
- `src/App.tsx` — main React app shell
- `src/services/api.ts` — complete API service layer with logging
- `src/services/upload.ts` — Excel parsing, validation, duplicate detection, template generation

---

## 11. What's Next (Trade Tables)

The immediate next step is the trade schema:

**`trade`** — base trade record (commodity-agnostic):
```
trade_id, trade_reference, trade_date, commodity_type, direction (BUY/SELL),
quantity, uom_id, price, currency_id, status, counterparty_id, trader_id,
book_id, legal_entity_id, product_id, market_id, pricing_rule_id,
incoterm_id, delivery_location_id, period_id, settlement_type,
trade_type (PHYSICAL/FINANCIAL/OPTION), parent_trade_id (for amendments)
```

**`trade_oil_detail`** — oil extension:
```
trade_id (FK, 1:1), crude_grade, api_gravity, sulphur_pct,
load_location_id, discharge_location_id, vessel_id,
laycan_start, laycan_end, bl_date, nors_tendered_date,
cod_date, pipeline_id, pipeline_point_id
```

**After trade tables:**
- Position engine schema
- Settlement / invoicing schema
- Spring Boot service layer (trade, position, risk)
- Python quant engine (curve building, MTM, VaR)
- React trade blotter UI

## 14. Static Data Admin UI — Lookup Table Design

Payment term dropdowns (Base Date Event and Business Day Convention) are driven by managed lookup tables, not hardcoded TypeScript enums. This means operations teams can add new event types without code changes.

**Pattern:**
1. Lookup table in SQL (e.g. `base_date_event_type`) with `type_code` matching the CHECK constraint on the data column
2. Entry in `PARENT_LOOKUP_TABLES` array in `referenceData.ts` — auto-registers the table in the Tier 2 Static Data UI
3. Frontend uses `useTableRows('base_date_event_type')` hook to load options at runtime
4. Form select uses grouped options (`applicableCommodity` as group header) with search enabled

**Tables managed via Static Data UI:**
- `base_date_event_type` — 11 payment date anchors (BL_DATE, DELIVERY_DATE, END_OF_DELIVERY_MONTH, etc.)
- `business_day_convention_type` — 5 BD rolling rules (MOD_FOLLOWING, FOLLOWING, etc.)
- `crude_grade_type` — 14 named crude grades (BRENT, WTI, FORTIES, URALS, DUBAI, ESPO, etc.) with region and benchmark index
- `metal_shape` — 9 physical metal forms (CATHODE, INGOT, BILLET, COIL, ROD, SLAB, WIRE, POWDER, T_BAR)
- `gas_day_type` — 3 gas day boundary types (STANDARD 06:00–06:00, MIDNIGHT, EXTENDED)
- `nomination_type` — 3 gas nomination types (FIRM, INTERRUPTIBLE, RENOMINATABLE)
- `lng_price_basis` — 6 LNG price linkages (JCC, HH, TTF, NBP, DES_SPOT, HYBRID)
- `power_load_type` — 4 power load profiles (BASELOAD, PEAK, OFF_PEAK, SHAPED)
- All other `PARENT_LOOKUP_TABLES` entries (commodity type, pricing type, UoM class, etc.)

**TradeBlotter dropdowns** — all formerly-hardcoded option arrays replaced with `useTableRows()` hooks and `useUom()`:
| Previously hardcoded | Now served by |
|---|---|
| `UOM_OPTIONS` | `useUom()` → `/api/v1/uom` |
| `CURRENCY_OPTIONS` | `useTableRows('currency')` |
| `CRUDE_GRADES` | `useTableRows('crude_grade_type')` |
| `METALS_SHAPES` | `useTableRows('metal_shape')` |
| `LNG_PRICE_BASES` | `useTableRows('lng_price_basis')` |
| inline `nominationType` options | `useTableRows('nomination_type')` |
| inline `gasDayType` options | `useTableRows('gas_day_type')` |
| inline `loadType` options | `useTableRows('power_load_type')` |

## 14a. Product Blend & Quality Spec Data Model

### Blend Products
A product can be flagged `is_blend = true` to indicate it is manufactured by blending component products. The recipe is stored in `product_blend_component`:

```
product_blend_component
├── parent_product_id   → blended product (e.g. GAS97-BLEND)
├── component_product_id → a constituent (e.g. ULSD-10PPM, ETHANOL)
├── sequence_no         → display order
├── min_pct / target_pct / max_pct  → volume-basis blending recipe
└── tolerance_pct       → allowable variance from target
```

**Example**: GAS97-BLEND = Component 1: ULSD-10PPM (target 97%vol ±0.5%) + Component 2: ETHANOL (target 3%vol ±0.25%).

### Quality Spec Templates
Spec data flows through three linked tables:

```
spec_parameter (parameter catalogue — API gravity, sulphur %, GCV, purity %, etc.)
    └── product_spec_template (named spec per product — e.g. EN590_10PPM for ULSD)
            └── product_spec_value (min/max/typical bounds per parameter)
                    └── spec_override (pipeline or vessel tighter requirements) [future]
```

**Seeded standards** (V24):
| Template Code | Product | Standard |
|---|---|---|
| DTBRT_BFOE_STD | BRENT-CRUDE | BFOE MoU 2023 |
| WTI_NYMEX_STD | WTI-CRUDE | NYMEX Rule 200 |
| TTF_EFET_2020 | TTF-GAS | NTA 8000 / EFET 2020 |
| LME_CU_GRADE_A | LME-COPPER | LME Annex A / BS EN 1978 |
| EN590_10PPM | ULSD-10PPM | EN 590:2022+A1 |
| GAS97_INTERNAL | GAS97-BLEND | EN 228:2012 / Internal |

### Frontend — ProductsPage Quality Specs Tab
The `ProductsPage.tsx` drawer now has 4 tabs:
- **Details** — all product fields including `isBlend` switch and `blendNotes` (shown when blend enabled)
- **Price Indices** — link/unlink price index relationships
- **Markets** — read-only view of market listings
- **Quality Specs** — blend recipe (when `isBlend=true`) + spec template accordion with parameter bounds table
